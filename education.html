            <b>Teen Volunteer Program:-</b> <b>What is the Teen Volunteer / Ambassador Program:</b>

The zoo offers a Teen Ambassador Volunteer Program for high-school–aged students interested in wildlife, conservation, and public engagement. 


<b>Through this program, teens help the zoo by:</b>

Volunteering in spaces like the zoo’s indoor nature play area (called “Zoomazium”). 


Helping in exhibits such as the zoo’s “Reptile Realm,” where they share information about reptiles and inspire guests to care about conservation. 


Observing and collecting data about animal behavior or how guests interact with exhibits — contributing to the zoo’s scientific / conservation efforts. 

Participating in weekly teen-meetings: a mix of conservation-career exploration, leadership development, public speaking, and teamwork. 

It’s not a program for “hands-on” animal care: teen volunteers do not work directly with animals or do behind-the-scenes animal care. Their role is more about guest engagement, education, outreach, and observational support.</b></li>

    <h2>Conservation Education</h2>
    <p>Inspiring visitors to protect wildlife and the environment.</p>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
       <center> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KtITaRT6FT4?si=-5wVLLimZ9t1yrfM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br>
        <li>Woodland Park Zoo’s “Learning & Innovation” department explicitly aims to “inspire and cultivate an informed community of conservation stewards.” Their educational programs are built around a science- and outcomes-based framework — not just showing animals, but fostering empathy, knowledge, and action toward conservation.</li>
        <li>The philosophy is: connecting people (from toddlers to seniors) to wildlife and nature — so that they understand why conservation matters, feel emotionally connected, and take responsibility for protecting ecosystems.</li>
        <li>The Zoo doesn’t treat education as just awareness or entertainment — it's part of a broader conservation mission. Their on-site education is tightly linked to real-world field-conservation programs: the Zoo supports projects ranging from species recovery in the Pacific Northwest to habitat protection globally.</li>
        <li>Through its educational offerings, the Zoo aims to not just inform, but empower — giving individuals the knowledge, empathy, and tools to take conservation actions, support wildlife beyond the zoo, and contribute to long-term ecological health.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Animal Encounters</h2>
    <p>Special learning sessions where visitors can meet animals up close.</p>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
       <center> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tLdX1owX8A?si=Dvd1xBJj0T79jjk1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br>
        <li><b>Keeper Talks:</b> Woodland Park Zoo schedules “Animal Keeper Talks” every day (roughly 10:30 a.m.–3:00 p.m., with times and species varying) as part of its daily program. 

These are public presentations by zoo keepers — usually near a particular exhibit (e.g. Brown Bear, Jaguar, Rhino, Wolves, Red Panda, Kea, etc.) depending on the day. 

The talks are free with zoo admission and meant to give visitors insight into the animals’ lives, care, and behaviors.</li><br> 
        <li><b>Feeding Sessions:</b> Watch animals enjoy their meals.</li><br>
        <li><b>Behind-the-Scenes Tours:</b> The zoo has offered special guided tours that go beyond the public exhibit paths — under names like “Real Close” tours or “Eye-to-Eye / Behind-the-Scenes” tours. 

These tours gave participants a chance to enter areas normally restricted to general visitors — e.g. animal-care zones, commissary (where animal food is prepared), behind locked-gates, and other “staff only” parts of the zoo.</li><br>
<li><b>The tours could include:</b>

Visiting the zoo’s central operations/food prep / “behind-the-scenes” zones. 

Getting a close-up look at some animal exhibits from unique vantage points (for example, a closer view of savanna animals, or a different perspective on the zoo’s African Savanna). 

A visit to the zoo’s greenhouses (where many of the plants for the exhibits are grown), showing the horticulture aspect of what makes the zoo’s habitats possible.

        <li>
            <b>Using the Zoo’s resources, educators can access:</b></li>

<li>Lesson plans and activity guides — structured to meet curriculum standards, covering topics like wildlife, habitats, ecosystems, conservation, biology, etc. (via Discovery Den) </li>

<li>Printable worksheets / coloring sheets / interactive activities / games — good for younger students or as supplementary material. </li>

<li>Videos / “behind-the-scenes” content & zookeeper interviews — can be used to show students how a zoo works, animal care, habitat maintenance, conservation messaging — even if you don’t visit in person. </li>


<li>Pre- and post-visit guides & resources — helps integrate a zoo visit into a school curriculum: prepare students ahead, tie visit to class topics, and follow up with discussions or projects after the visit. </li>

<li>Support for different learning levels — from early-childhood (toddlers/kindergarten) through teens, which makes the resources flexible for varied classroom settings and age groups. </li>

<li>Accessibility & inclusion — according to the zoo’s reports, resources (some) are designed with accessibility in mind (e.g. Universal Design for Learning), making it easier to adapt for diverse learners. </li>

    <h2>Science & Research</h2>
    <p>Discover how the zoo helps advance global wildlife knowledge.</p>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
        <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xsz09J86YtI?si=X0pi2GrO2-ij2Zvg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br>
        <li><b>Field Conservation & Species-Survival Programs:-</b>

Woodland Park Zoo runs a program called the Wildlife Survival Program — it funds and supports field-conservation projects globally, for threatened species that the Zoo may house or support. 

Their conservation portfolio spans many regions and species — from big mammals to reptiles, aquatic species, and even invertebrates. 

Through these efforts, the Zoo helps maintain biodiversity, support wild populations, and fund research, habitat protection, and species recovery.</li>
        <li><p><b>Signature & Long-Term Research Programs:-</b>

A major example: the Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program (TKCP). This program studies ecology, behavior, habitat use, and conservation management of a threatened species — the Matschie’s tree kangaroo — in Papua New Guinea. 

Research under TKCP involves advanced tools: for instance, “Crittercams” (animal-mounted cameras) to study elusive tree-kangaroos in their natural habitat (in cloud-forest canopy) across elevations. This helps inform habitat-management decisions and conservation strategies. 

The Zoo — by supporting such field research — acts not only as a site for captive-animal care but as a source of scientific data and conservation biology research applied in the wild.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Local / Regional Ecology & Community Science:-</b>

Through the Living Northwest initiative, Woodland Park Zoo works on species and ecosystem conservation in its home region (Pacific Northwest). 

As part of that, the Zoo runs a formal Community Science arm — public volunteers help monitor local wildlife. Programs include amphibian monitoring (wetlands), bat-activity surveys, tracking bobcats/coyotes/urban carnivores, etc. 

This gives non-scientists a chance to contribute to real data gathering, and helps the Zoo map species distributions, behavior, habitat use, and responses to environmental changes in the wild.</p></li>
