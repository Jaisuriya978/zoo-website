            <h3>African Savanna</h3>
            <p>The African Savanna exhibit is designed to recreate the grasslands of East Africa: expansive plains supporting a variety of herbivores and predators. 


The exhibit isn’t just about animals — you enter through a replica “East African village,” complete with traditional-style huts, a schoolhouse, thatch-roofed buildings, and cultural/educational displays. 


The immersive, naturalistic design (trees, grasses, open spaces, subtle barriers) helps animals roam and behave more like they would in the wild — a principle that the zoo helped pioneer.</p>
<p>
    In African Savanna you can see a variety of iconic African wildlife. Some of the animals include:

<b>Herbivores: giraffes, zebras, ostriches are among the main attractions. 

Other species: there are also exhibits for animals such as patas monkeys, and a small aviary for savanna birds. 

Carnivores / big mammals: The savanna section includes enclosures for animals like African lions and (in past descriptions) warthogs — giving visitors a chance to appreciate both prey and predator species from Africa.</b>
</p>
<p>When you visit, you walk in through the “village,” which gives a kind of transition from city to wild — the village setting gradually gives way to open savanna landscape and animals roaming. 

You’ll likely see giraffes, zebras, ostriches — the big herbivores are often out in the open, giving good views. 

There’s variety — from tall giraffes to smaller monkeys or savanna birds — giving a broad representation of savanna fauna in one place. 


Because the exhibit emphasizes naturalism and space, you get a more “wild” and immersive feel than a traditional zoo cage-based layout.

            <h3>Trophical Rainforest</h3>
            <p>The Tropical Rain Forest is one of the main bioclimatic-habitat zones at Woodland Park Zoo. It is designed to mimic real tropical rain forests — combining species from both South America and Africa. 


The exhibit aims to recreate different rainforest layers — from forest floor to canopy — giving visitors a sense of the vertical complexity and biodiversity of real rain forests. 

It includes both outdoor and indoor areas: an outdoor loop for some primates and other animals, and an indoor rainforest “dome/house” where birds, amphibians, reptiles and other rainforest-adapted creatures live — simulating humid, tropical habitat conditions.</p>
<p>
    In this exhibit you’ll encounter a variety of rainforest species from different continents. Some notable ones:<br>
<b>
From Africa (outdoor rainforest loop):
</b>
Western lowland gorilla — the zoo’s gorilla habitat in the Rain Forest exhibit was a pioneering immersion-style outdoor gorilla exhibit when it opened. 


Ring‑tailed Lemur and Red‑ruffed Lemur — lemurs climbing and roaming among trees. 

Colobus Monkey — another primate species featured in the rainforest area.
<br>
<b>
From South America (indoor rainforest house / dome):</b>

Jaguar — the jungle cat is part of the rainforest’s large-cat exhibits, giving a taste of the dense-forest predators of the Americas. 


Various birds — tropical rainforest birds (e.g. toucans) — flying or perched in a densely planted aviary that simulates a forest canopy. 

Amphibians & reptiles — colourful rainforest dwellers such as poison dart frogs, snakes, and more — typical of humid rainforest floors and understory. 
<br>
So you get a mix: big mammals (primates, big cats), smaller animals (frogs, snakes, birds), all sharing a habitat designed to simulate real rainforest ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>The Tropical Rain Forest exhibit at Woodland Park Zoo is a celebrated, award-winning exhibit. It helped set standards for immersive, naturalistic zoo habitats. <br>
By housing a wide variety of species across taxonomic groups (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians), the exhibit underscores how rainforests support enormous biodiversity — and why protecting rainforest ecosystems worldwide is vital.
<br>
For visitors (especially families, children, anyone interested in nature), the exhibit offers a vivid, memorable “walk through a jungle” experience — combining education, wonder, and connection to real-world ecosystems.

            <h3>Living Northern Trail</h3>
            <p>The Trail is designed to represent northern habitats such as tundra, taiga, and montane environments — similar to those in Alaska and northern North America. 

With immersive landscaping (rocks, water, “goat cliffs”, forested and open-space habitats, underwater viewing for aquatic animals) the zoo aims to evoke a naturalistic northern environment rather than traditional cages. </p>
            <p>At the Living Northwest / Northern Trail you can see a variety of animals adapted to cold or temperate–cold climates, including:

Arctic Fox — one of the most iconic cold-region mammals. Their fur changes seasonally (white winter coat for camouflage), and they’re housed in this section. 

Gray Wolf / newly added wolf-pack — wolves are part of the Northern Trail/Living Northwest species lineup. 

Brown Bear (Grizzly-type / Northwest bear) — large bear species well suited to taiga / northern-forest habitats. 

Mountain Goat — adapted to alpine/montane cold-region terrain, also part of this zone. 

Snowy Owl (and possibly other northern birds/raptors) — representing avian species adapted to northern/tundra or boreal climates. 


Other local Northwest/far-north species where relevant — the Living Northwest Trail includes some animals native to northern North America, reflecting diversity beyond just “Arctic fox & friends.”</p>
<p>The Trail is built to simulate a real northern-habitat trail. According to design documentation, the original Northern Trail (completed 1994) spans about 11 acres and was created with attention to ecological realism: native plants, rockwork, underwater-viewing for aquatic animals (bears, otters), “goat cliffs” for mountain goats and eagle perches, and more. 

Visitors move through a sequence of landscapes — sometimes forested, sometimes open, sometimes rocky or watery — giving a sense of “wilderness journey.” It’s not just a walk past enclosures; it’s shaped to reflect natural habitats. 

The area emphasizes education and conservation of Northwest (and broadly northern) wildlife — not just exotic “far-north” species, but also regional wildlife that shares similar habitats. The exhibit now includes a conservation center for local species (e.g. turtles) as part of its broader ecological mission.</p>

            <h3>Temperate Forest</h3>
            <p>The Temperate Forest zone is one of the bioclimatic-habitat exhibits at Woodland Park Zoo — designed to simulate forests similar to those in temperate climates (like the Pacific Northwest and temperate regions globally). 

Rather than grouping animals just by geography, the zoo uses a “bioclimatic zone” approach: animals are grouped by the type of habitat/climate they’re adapted to. 

Within the Temperate Forest, you’ll find several sub-areas: wetlands, aviaries (for various birds), a “Wildlife Survival Zone,” and even a “Family Farm & Contact Area” plus a “Bug World” — making it a mix of wild animals, domestic/farm animals, small invertebrates, and birds</p>
        <p>When you visit Temperate Forest, you may encounter a variety of species — from mammals to birds to invertebrates. Some of the animals and creatures include:
<b>
Mammals: Red Panda, Maned Wolf, and small deer species like Southern Pudu. 
<br>
Birds & Wetland-species: Among the birds are Chilean Flamingo, cranes like Red‑crowned Crane and White‑naped Crane, and other aviary birds and wetland-adapted species. 
<br>
Smaller creatures & invertebrates: In the “Bug World,” you can see insects, spiders, and other small creatures — often overlooked but vital for ecosystems. 
<br>
Farm / Domestic-type animals (in Family Farm/Contact Area): There’s a section with barn/farm animals like goats, pigs, chickens, miniature cows (or small cattle), donkeys — especially great for kids or visitors who want a more hands-on/interactive experience.</b>
            </p>
            <p>The layout is designed to be immersive rather than like traditional cages: naturalistic enclosures, wetlands, aviaries, mixed-species zones, and green spaces that evoke real forest/wetland habitats. This aligns with the zoo’s broader philosophy of replicating natural environments for animals — an idea that helped define its design philosophy. 

There’s a mix of wildlife and interactive/farm-animal encounters: if you visit with kids or enjoy up-close animal experiences, the Family Farm & Contact Area and Bug World add variety beyond just viewing wild animals.

Because animals come from varied temperate-region habitats worldwide, you get a global taste — not just local Northwest forest fauna. This lets visitors appreciate biodiversity across temperate ecosystems.
