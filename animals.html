        <h2>Rhino</h2>
        <p>Rhinos are large herbivores known for their horns and thick skin.
            The Greater One-Horned Rhino is also known as the Indian rhino. It is the largest of the world’s surviving rhino species, with a single horn and a distinct “armor-plated” skin appearance due to prominent skin folds. 
Their wild populations were once extremely low (under 200 in India and Nepal during the early 20th century), but thanks to conservation efforts, numbers have increased — illustrating why zoological programs like the zoo’s rhino exhibit matter for species survival.
        </p>
        <p>Glenn:

Glenn is a male Greater One‑Horned Rhinoceros at Woodland Park Zoo. 

He was born on November 11, 2016 at a conservation facility (The Wilds, Ohio) and arrived at the zoo as a juvenile to be part of the new rhino exhibit. 

In 2023 when both rhinos — Glenn and his companion — were 7 years old, Glenn’s recorded weight was about 4,135 pounds.

He is currently the sole rhino at the zoo, after his companion moved out (see below). <br>

Taj (formerly at the zoo):

Taj (full name “Taj Mahal”) was the first rhino ever at Woodland Park Zoo — a male Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros born on November 10, 2016 at San Diego Zoo Safari Park. 

He arrived at the zoo at about 17 months old (in early 2018) and made his public debut when the zoo opened its new exhibit, Assam Rhino Reserve. 


When first moved, he weighed ~1,500 lbs; as of 2023 he weighed around 4,670 pounds. 
In late 2023, Taj was scheduled to be moved to another zoo (El Paso Zoo) as per the species-management plan.

        <h2>Giraffe</h2>
        <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals with long necks and legs.
The giraffes at Woodland Park Zoo live in the zoo’s “African Savanna” exhibit, which recreates the grasslands of East Africa. Giraffes share the space there with other African species like zebras, ostriches, etc. 

The zoo doesn’t just display giraffes — it also participates in conservation and awareness efforts for wild giraffes through its partnership with Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF). 

According to the zoo, giraffes are the tallest mammals in the world: adult height ranges from 14 to 19 feet. Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern, no two are the same. Their tongues are bluish-purple and measure about 17–19 inches long.
        </p>
        <p>One of the giraffes at Woodland Park is named Dave — he arrived at the zoo in 2014 from another zoo.<br> 
<b>Hasani:</b>
In 2019 the zoo welcomed a baby giraffe named Hasani (born May 2, 2019). Shortly after birth, Hasani had to be fitted with custom-made therapeutic shoes due to abnormalities in his rear legs (“hyperextended fetlocks”). 

Thanks to the treatments — which included custom shoes and later kinesiology taping — Hasani’s condition improved. At that point, the zoo reported he was walking and running normally. 

Later, Hasani was moved from Woodland Park Zoo to a different facility in Texas. The zoo said he was being relocated as part of a breeding and placement decision.

Through its partnership with the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, Woodland Park Zoo contributes to efforts to protect giraffes in the wild — raising awareness, supporting habitat conservation in Africa, and funding anti-poaching and monitoring efforts. 

By housing giraffes and allowing visitors to observe them — including calves like Hasani — the zoo aims to foster appreciation for giraffes and highlight their conservation needs.

        <h2>Zebra</h2>
        <p>Zebras are wild horses famous for their black-and-white stripes.
            The zebras at the zoo live in the African Savanna section, which combines giraffes, zebras, ostriches and other savanna species. 
Historically, the zoo has kept “plains zebra” (scientific name Plains Zebra, Equus quagga) in that savanna habitat. 
The savanna design aims for a more naturalistic, herd-style environment — providing public viewing vantage points like the “Savanna Overlook,” where visitors may see zebras grazing among other savanna animals.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to a zebra-species list published by the zoo, they have “plains zebra” listed as part of their mammals. 
Over the years, individual zebras at Woodland Park Zoo have included names like a male named Furahi — he was euthanized in 2012 after suffering from serious health problems. 

Earlier (in 2006) the zoo euthanized a zebra named Rosie, who had been part of the zoo since 1977 — she reportedly gave birth to 14 foals during her life there. 
Seattle Post-Intelligencer

As with many zoos, the population and individuals change over time. So while zebras remain part of the African Savanna collection, which exact individuals are present can vary

        <h2>Tiger</h2>
<p>The Malayan tiger (scientific name Panthera tigris jacksoni) is classified as critically endangered. 
Wild population estimates suggest that fewer than 150–200 remain in the wild — a dramatic decline from past decades. 
The dramatic decline is primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation 
(much of the tiger’s natural rainforest home in Peninsular Malaysia is being converted for agriculture — notably palm oil plantations),
plus poaching, and prey depletion. 
Inside Climate News. Loss of the Malayan tiger not only threatens a charismatic species — as an apex predator, their disappearance would destabilize their ecosystems, leading to overpopulation of prey species and long-term ecological damage. 
harimau.gov.my Captive-based conservation (as done by Woodland Park Zoo) — through breeding programs (like the Malayan Tiger Species Survival Plan), habitat-style exhibits, public education — plays a vital role in raising awareness and preserving genetic diversity.</p>
<p>
    Bumi:

    Bumi is a male Malayan tiger at the zoo. He was born in 2010, making him one of the older tigers currently residing there. 


He arrived at Woodland Park Zoo from Audubon Zoo in New Orleans (when he was younger) to join the zoo’s tiger program. 


The zoo (via the Association of Zoos & Aquariums’ Malayan Tiger Species Survival Plan) has recommended pairing Bumi and Azul — hoping they might breed in future to help with conservation efforts. 

In captive care, Bumi reportedly enjoys enrichment items (boxes, paper bags) and even “perfume” scents provided by keepers — tigers often rub on scented objects as part of enrichment
    </p>

    <p>Azul:
        
        Azul is the first female Malayan tiger at the zoo. She was born on January 5, 2016 at Bronx Zoo in New York. 


Because her mother did not provide proper care, Azul was hand-raised as a cub — which has shaped her calm, mellow temperament. 


She moved to Woodland Park Zoo in 2021 and spent 30 days in quarantine before joining the naturalistic habitat there. 

As of now, in the zoo’s habitat rotation schedule, Azul shares access (on alternating schedules) with the zoo’s male Malayan tiger(s), rather than staying with them simultaneously — since tigers are mostly solitary animals.

        <h2>Lion</h2>
        <p>Lions live in groups called prides and are known as kings of the jungle.</p>
        <p>Tandie (male):

Tandie was born at Woodland Park Zoo in 2014 (as part of a litter with two brothers) to parents Adia and Xerxes. 

After spending some years away (at another zoo), he returned to Woodland Park Zoo in late 2022 to take up residence in the Savanna lion habitat. 

According to the zoo, Tandie is “thoughtful, smart” and displays calm, confident behavior. He enjoys meat and — amusingly — “blood popsicles” (a keeper enrichment treat) when he gets them. 
<br>

Ilanga (female):

Ilanga is the lioness sharing the African Savanna habitat with Tandie. As of 2025, they are described as “queen and king of the Savanna.” 

The zoo currently does not have a breeding recommendation between Tandie and Ilanga — meaning they are paired for social/companionship reasons rather than immediate breeding. </p>

<p>
    Previously, the zoo had a male lion named Xerxes — he fathered cubs, including Tandie — but Xerxes was euthanized in 2022 due to kidney failure. 


There was a female lioness named Adia who died in 2019 from surgical complications. She had been the zoo’s main lioness and mother of multiple cubs. 

The zoo has had several litters over the years; for example, in 2014, three lion cubs (all male) were born to Adia and Xerxes.

        <h2>Jaguar</h2>
        <p>The jaguars at Woodland Park Zoo live in the “Jaguar Cove” — a habitat within the zoo’s “Tropical Rain Forest” section, designed to approximate the lush Central/South American rainforest where jaguars naturally live. 

Jaguars are the largest feline species in the Western Hemisphere (third largest cat overall after tiger and lion). 

In the wild, jaguars are solitary animals requiring large territories as they hunt and roam alone; in captivity too they are usually kept singly or as per careful management plans.</p>
        <p>Its distinctively marked coat features pale yellow to tan coloured fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides, although a melanistic black coat appears in some individuals.</p>
        <p><b>Fitz:</b>As of 2020, the zoo introduced a male jaguar named Fitz, transferred from another zoo. He was described as young (two years old at arrival), with a relatively lighter coat and smaller size compared to adult males. <br>
<b>Nayla:</b>
The zoo previously had a female jaguar, Nayla, who was its only female jaguar — she lived at the zoo since 2006, but sadly was humanely euthanized in October 2024 due to severe age-related mobility issues. <br>
<b>Junior:</b>
Another past resident was a male jaguar (named Junior) who was euthanized in 2019 after a long life of about 20 years — older than average for zoo-kept jaguars.
            </p>
            <p>The zoo participates in the species-management program for jaguars (the Species Survival Plan, SSP), which aims to maintain healthy captive populations, ensure genetic diversity, and support broader conservation efforts for jaguars in the wild. 
<br>

Through Jaguar Cove and its jaguar residents, Woodland Park Zoo gives visitors a chance to learn about jaguars — their behavior, natural habitat, threats they face (like habitat loss) — helping raise awareness and support for conservation

        <h2>Snow Leopard</h2>
        <p>
            The zoo keeps Snow Leopard, a majestic big-cat species native to high mountain ranges across Central and South Asia. Their natural camouflage coloring and cold-adapted fur make them well-suited to mountainous, rocky habitats. 

The zoo’s association with snow leopards goes back decades: their first snow leopards arrived in 1972 (from the former USSR). 

Over the years, the zoo has been part of a coordinated captive-breeding program (the Snow Leopard Trust and the broader species-management plan), to help ensure genetic diversity and to support long-term conservation of the species.
<br>
            An alpine specialist whose conservation helps protect fragile high-elevation ecosystems</p>
        <p>
            In 2024, the zoo welcomed three new snow leopard cubs, born on Memorial Day (May 27) to<b> mom Marai (age 7) and dad Aibek (age 6). </b>
<br>
The cubs have been named:

<b>Lenny (male)

Phyllis (female)

Raya (female).</b>
<br>
As it’s typical for snow leopards (which are solitary in the wild), the cubs’ father Aibek and their grandmother (formerly resident) were housed separately from mom and cubs to reduce stress. 
<br>
The zoo had to say goodbye to some of their long-time snow leopards recently:

In January 2023, a male snow leopard, Dhirin (≈ 17 years old) was humanely euthanized due to severe health issues (kidney failure and respiratory problems). 
Woodland Park Zoo Blog

In May 2025, the zoo also euthanized longtime matriarch Helen (≈ 20 years old), due to declining health associated with kidney disease. 

Despite those losses, the new cubs — Lenny, Phyllis, and Raya — carry on the snow-leopard lineage at the zoo, alongside parents like Marai and Aibek.

        <h2>Maned Wolf</h2>
        <pre>The “maned wolf” isn’t really a wolf or a fox, but a distinct species: Maned Wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus). They are known for their long, stilt-like legs, reddish coat, and a mane of darker fur on their neck/back. 
In the wild, maned wolves inhabit grasslands and scrub forests of central South America. They are mostly solitary, often active at dawn or dusk (crepuscular), and have a diet that includes fruits, small mammals, birds, eggs, and invertebrates. 

They communicate not primarily by vocalizing but via scent marking — their urine is a strong signal, which helps them mark territories. 

Conservation-wise, maned wolves are listed as “near threatened,” mainly due to habitat fragmentation, disease, human expansion, and other threats. Zoos like Woodland Park participate in coordinated breeding and conservation efforts to help preserve the species.</pre>
<p>
    As of late 2023 / early 2024, the zoo houses two maned wolves: Urso and Rosario. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Urso:</b> a young male born on January 31, 2022 (at another zoo), moved to Woodland Park Zoo along with Rosario. Urso is notable because he lost his tail as a pup due to injury. <br>

<b>Rosario:</b> a female, born March 7, 2016, came from Sedgwick County Zoo (via another zoo) before arriving at Woodland Park. She reportedly settled into the new habitat well. 
<br>
According to the zoo, these two currently live together, but “there are no plans for them to breed” — they’re essentially companions.

        <h2>Brown Bear</h2>
        <p>The bears live in the zoo’s “Living Northwest Trail” habitat — a naturalistic space designed to mimic northwest forest / mountainous-region environment, with rocks, a stream/pool, logs, and a den-area.</p>
        <p>
            The zoo is home to two young adult brown/grizzly bears: <b>Juniper and Fern</b>. <br>

<b>Juniper:</b> a coastal brown bear rescued as a cub after being found alone on an air-force base outside Anchorage, Alaska; she arrived at the zoo in 2022. <br>

<b>Fern:</b> a “grizzly bear” (i.e. inland subspecies of brown bear) — was rescued in Montana in 2022 when her mother was euthanized after repeated human–wildlife conflicts
        </p>
        <p>As young rescued bears, when they first arrived, keepers modified enclosures to ensure safety: added enrichment, bear-appropriate furniture, secure barriers — since the cubs (Juniper and first cub) were “very young, curious, and likely to explore every nook and cranny.” 

The enclosure includes a swimming area / pool (because brown bears often swim and forage in water in the wild), trees/stumps for scratching or climbing, and a den for resting or winter-type hibernation/torpor
        </p>
        <p>
            Juniper and Fern get along fairly well: though they come from different origins and subspecies, the zoo has described them as “fast becoming best buds.” 

From keepers’ reports: Juniper tends to be the more playful and sensitive one — easily startled but curious — while Fern is more confident and “deep-thinking.” 


The zoo observes that when first introduced together, they were hesitant; but the next morning they were found “wrestling in the yard” — an encouraging sign they accepted each other.

        <h2>Patas Monkey</h2>
        <p>The patas monkey is scientifically known as Erythrocebus patas. They are ground-dwelling primates native to grasslands, savannas and dry woodlands of Africa. 

Patas monkeys are notable for being among the fastest primates — in the wild they can run at very high speeds to escape predators. 

Their body structure: long limbs adapted for running, rather than swinging through trees — unlike many other monkeys.</p>
<p>
    In 2013 the zoo introduced a pair: a female named <b>Acacia (8-years old at the time) and a male named SeiKei (4-years old), and they were placed together in the African Savanna exhibit</b>. 


Before that, there was a male named Kyle, who in 2011 underwent surgery to amputate one limb due to a serious infection — the zoo rehabilitated him and reintroduced him to the exhibit. 
<br>
So the zoo has maintained patas monkeys for some time, with individual animals sometimes changing due to health or management reasons.
<br>
<b>Recently (2025) welcomed three new patas monkeys: two females — Zarina (12 years old) and Grace (12), and one male — Dayo (11).</b>

According to that 2025 update, these new arrivals joined Acacia (who was already part of the zoo’s African Savanna collection).

        <h2>Gaint Forest Tortoise</h2>
        <p>The “giant forest tortoise” at Woodland Park Zoo refers to the species Manouria emys, also commonly known as the Asian forest tortoise (or Asian giant tortoise / Asian mountain tortoise, among other names). 

Manouria emys is the largest tortoise native to mainland Asia. Among its distinguishing traits: a broad, relatively flattened shell (carapace), and a heavy lower shell (plastron). 

In the wild, it lives in forest habitats in Southeast Asia (southern Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo) or in northeastern-Indian / northwestern-Thailand regions depending on the subspecies.</p>
        <p>The Asian forest tortoise is the largest tortoise species native to mainland Asia. Adults can reach a shell length up to ~ 60 cm (straight carapace length) and weigh up to ~ 35–37 kg (some sources say “over 35 kg”). 

Their shell is domed and dark (brown or blackish for adults), while juveniles are often lighter (yellowish-brown with darker markings). 

Limbs are thick and robust, with heavy, scaly legs — adapted for moving on forest floor, digging, and navigating undergrowth.</p>
        <p>As mentioned, Manouria emys is among the most basal (primitive) living tortoises — interesting from an evolutionary/phylogenetic standpoint. 

Their conservation status is serious: the Asian forest tortoise is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), which makes zoos’ role in safeguarding captive populations — and potentially participating in breeding or awareness programs — more significant.</p>
        <p>The presence of the giant forest tortoise at Woodland Park Zoo reflects how over time the zoo evolved from a simple menagerie to a modern institution aiming to represent diverse ecosystems — including forest habitats and reptiles, not just big mammals. While we don’t have publicly accessible records about when exactly the first Manouria emys arrived, the species is part of the zoo’s current “Reptile Realm,” actively cared for and exhibited. Their inclusion also highlights broader conservation efforts, representing threatened forest species and contributing to awareness of endangered reptiles.</p>

        <h2>Humboldt Penguin</h2>
        <p>Humboldt penguins are native to the coasts of Peru and Chile — i.e. rocky, arid coastal regions, not icy or snowy regions like many people expect for penguins. 

Their characteristic appearance includes a broad C-shaped band of white feathers on the head, black markings along the body sides crossing the abdomen’s white plumage, and a distinctive fleshy pink area on the face. 

At Woodland Park Zoo, the penguins live in a carefully designed exhibit that simulates their natural habitat: rocky coastlines, tide pools, shoreline cliffs, and a beach. 

The exhibit includes underwater-viewing windows — allowing visitors to observe the penguins “flying” underwater (they use their wings to swim at speeds up to ~20 mph).</p>

        <p>The penguin habitat at Woodland Park Zoo was remodeled (opened in 2009) to be both realistic and sustainable. 

It uses “green” practices: geothermal heating/cooling, rainwater collection, and a “constructed wetland” filtration system that recycles pool water — reducing water and energy use substantially. 

According to the zoo, this setup saves roughly 3,000,000 gallons of water and 22,000 kilowatt-hours of energy each year.</p>
        <p>The zoo runs a formal breeding program for Humboldt penguins under the Humboldt Penguin Species Survival Plan (SSP), which coordinates breeding across accredited zoos to maintain healthy genetic diversity. 

As of a recent update (April 2025), the colony at Woodland Park Zoo includes about 41 penguins. 

Their most recent hatchling — a female chick — was born on March 28, 2025 to parents named <b>“Mini” and “Gomez</b>.” 

Since the first breeding season in 2010, the zoo has had dozens of successful hatchings (nearly 100 by 2025).</p>
        <p>In the wild, Humboldt penguins are considered vulnerable/endangered. 

Threats include overfishing (reducing their food supply, especially anchovies), human disturbance, and habitat degradation. 

The zoo’s breeding and conservation efforts — including cooperation with conservation centers in their native range — contribute to species survival.</p>
